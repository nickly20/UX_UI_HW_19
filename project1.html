        <h2>challenge</h2>
        <p>NASA's current website suffers from a text-heavy, cluttered, and disorganized design, which makes it difficult for users to navigate and find relevant content. The website's interface lacks a clear hierarchy of information, resulting in a confusing user experience. The excessive use of text also makes it challenging for users to quickly scan and find what they need. This issue is compounded by the website's cluttered layout, which features an overwhelming amount of information on each page. As a result, users are likely to feel overwhelmed and frustrated by the website's design, leading to a poor user experience. A redesign of the NASA website is necessary to address these issues and create a more user-friendly and visually appealing platform for sharing NASA's work and achievements with the public.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container-3">
        <h2>solution</h2>
        <p>A solution for the NASA website redesign would be to implement new design elements such as a clean, modern layout with a clear information hierarchy, reduced text content, and improved navigation. This could be achieved by conducting user research to determine user needs and preferences and using a responsive design to optimize the website for various devices.
        </p>
        <p>The ultimate goal would be to create a website that effectively showcases NASA's research, discoveries, and achievements to the public, while also making it easier for users to navigate and find the information they need.  Additionally, a website with increased traffic could help NASA communicate its research and discoveries to a broader audience, promoting science,  increasing public understanding and support for its work.

            <h2>Sitemap</h2>
                <p>To improve the user experience of the NASA website, we reorganized the site navigation into four main sections: Articles, Missions, Follow, and Contents. We consolidated all relevant items, with the goal of making the site more intuitive to navigate. We prioritized categories that we recognized as carrying the most traffic and outlined the major components of the site within these sections. Ultimately, this resulted in a more streamlined and user-friendly navigation experience.

                <p>During the redesign process of the NASA website, our team experimented with several alternate sitemap orientations for the navigation bar. We considered various options that we believed could be more effective in organizing and presenting the site's content. However, after thorough evaluation and user testing, we found that nesting all components into four major categories titled "Articles", "Missions", "Follow", and "Content" was the most logical and user-friendly approach. This allowed us to consolidate all relevant items while making it easy for users to understand and navigate the site's content.

The UI dimension must demonstrate succinct animation, font, layout, and information display. Stylistically the UI must be clean, thorough, and technical while avoiding an esoteric nature that is inherit in astronomy. By making more dynamic animations, introducing inviting colors, and consolidating user paths the site will be made more palpable to the average visitor.
